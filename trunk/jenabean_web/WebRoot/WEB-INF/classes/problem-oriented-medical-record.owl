This Semantic Web Ontology document (for self-hosted Medical Records) was written with a [faithful rendition](http://www.w3.org/2004/01/rdxh/spec#sec_rend) (GRDDL) in mind for consumption by  Semantic Web Agents, lay people, logicians,  *and* more ubiquitous markup user agents.

It is generated by a Python software library which takes an OWL/XML document with the following additional (embedded) formats:

* Markdown
* RDF Vocabularies: [SKOS](http://www.w3.org/TR/swbp-skos-core-spec) / Ontology of Biomedical Investigation ([OBO](http://obi.sourceforge.net/)) vocabulary / Dublin Core ([DC](http://dublincore.org/documents/dces/))

.. and generates a host XHTML document with the following (embeded) formats:

* GRDDL (OWL RDF/XML)
* Manchester OWL [Syntax](http://owl-workshop.man.ac.uk/acceptedLong/submission_9.pdf)
* LaTex (eventually)</dc:description>
    <dc:description>## Definition ##

The goal is to define a minimal set of terms that connect representations from well defined healthcare information &amp;amp; process models 
(such as [HL7 RIM](http://www.hl7.org/library/data-model/RIM/C30202/rim.htm)) with more expressive [foundational](http://ontology.buffalo.edu/bio/OBR.pdf) 
ontologies of biology (both domain-agnostic and those specific to the domains of life sciences and healthcare) through the use of the criteria [outlined](http://www.pkc.com/papers/pomr.pdf) in 
  the traditional Problem-oriented Medical Record structure.
  
## Meeting CPR Requirements ##

This is an attempt to demonstrate how a few best practices in ontology and software engineering can be applied to address the problem 
of the lack of a unified vocabulary for Computer-based Patient Records (CPR)  
  
## Problem-oriented Medical Record Methodology ##

> The fundamental motivation for the design and philosophy of the Problem-Oriented Medical Record (POMR) 
> is the belief that the medical record is the central medium of communication and the first repository 
> of knowledge in the practice of clinical medicine    

## KR Methodology ##

Elisabeth Bayegan's methodology (outlined in full within her PhD [thesis](http://www.idi.ntnu.no/~bayegan/pub/ebthesis.pdf)) is followed as
 a means for capturing clinical content in an RDF knowledge base with syntactic and semantic extensions for *DLP* (and RIF?) expressivity (RDFLib)
      
## KR (Description Logic) Syntax ##

Wherever possible, the Manchester OWL Syntax (@@TODO References) is adopted to capture axiomatic semantics of DL terminologies.            
      
## GALEN' Role classes ##

GALEN's role classes are used heavily to categorize (for instance):

* Clinical social roles (physician, nurse, patient, etc..)
* Other roles: DiagnosisRole, SignRole, SymptomRole, ..     

## OBO Links ##

The dependent OBO ontologies can be [browsed](http://www.bioontology.org/ncbo/faces/pages/ontology_list.xhtml)

## Anatomical Ontology ##

Foundational Model of Anatomy [FMA](http://www.bioontology.org/ncbo/faces/pages/ontology_details.xhtml?ontology_display_name=FMA) is adopted for describing anatomical constructs.

### Knowledge Representation for Relevance Ranking of Patient-Record Contents in Primary-Care Situations

Elisabeth Bayegan follows the clinical headings set as a framework for a class of 'clinical acts':

> The NHS Clinical Headings Project’s main objective has been to identify a limited number of headings that will perform
> the jobs that are needed for clinical communicationand navigation and that can be agreed upon by every participant
> involved in clinical communication. The project produced a well-established framework of clinical headings
> compatible with HL7 and CEN TC251’s standardization work on electronic patient records. Clinical Headings refer
> to a set of words and phrases that clinicians use to name sections of their communications (e.g., symptoms, examination
> findings, test results, diagnosis, etc.). Clinical headings have no formal syntax or definition, therefore, our content
> ontology represents the formal data structures needed to strictly define concepts in the patient record.

Her methodology (outlined in full within her PhD [thesis](http://www.idi.ntnu.no/~bayegan/pub/ebthesis.pdf)) is followed as
 a means for capturing clinical content in an RDF knowledge base.  The support for a abstract clinical workflow is also an 
 asset in possible combinations with the HCLS Advanced Clinical Protocols and Pathways ontology being developed in the W3C. 

### Care Acts and Agents - Modeling the Clinical Workflow

Bayegan:

> We distinguish between the direct observations (the patient's problem statement and
> physician's observations) and the interpretations that are done on these observations
> (assessment, diagnostics, and treatment actions). This distinction between the input
> to a process and the actions based on the input is also reflected in our CareActType
> ontology (Figure 8.5). The CareActType ontology has four main classes that jut out
> from the root concept THING (1) case history, (2) assessment, (3) diagnosis, and
> (4) treatment. The former class represents the information input to the care process,
> while the three latter classes represent the actions done in the care process (i.e., based
> on interpretations).

  <owl:Class rdf:about="#clinical-description"
             rdfs:label="clinical description">
    <OBI:definition>Corresponds (at least syntactically) with the HL7 RIM Act Class, insofar as it is the class of clinical recordings (a REPRESENTATIONAL ARTIFACT) of a natural phenomenon 
      (cpr:medical-problem, cpr:clinical-act, and anything else of clinical relevance) by an individual.  Collections of such recordings, each of which is related to a person,
      manifests as the patient record.</OBI:definition>
    <dc:description>### Reconciling HL7 RIM Inconsistencies

The *cpr:clinical-description* class is an attempt to reconcile the ontological inconsistencies with the archetype of 
a recording of an act and the thing the recording describes (which could be either a continuant / endurant or an occurrant / perdurant).            
                  
### about

> The relation between information objects and entities they are about. The difference with 'expresses' is that the last 
> requires a situation to be about something. E.g. Dante's Comedy is about facts like Dante's travel to the hereafter. 
> The Comedy expresses a script as well as various related meanings, while the facts talked about are not 'expressed'.
> Given that descriptions are expressed by at least one IO, and that interpretations of IOs requires conceiving a description, 
> and the (plausible) claim that being about something can only be done in context, i.e. within a situation, we can propose 
> that the conceived description is satisfied by the situation (the context) of the entity the IO is about.On this basis, 
> about would result to be a mediated relation. This is still a proposal, then we keep about here as a primitive for some time.

### depiction

> An information realization consisting of depicted images/signs of any sort (e.g. graffiti, drawings, inscriptions, pictures, 
> sculptures, etc.), which are inscripted on a medium that lasts longer than the depicting act. It also includes any early form 
> of inscripted iconic expression, which can be considered as original bodily expressions.

### REPRESENTATIONAL ARTIFACT

> A representation that is fixed in some medium in such a way that it can serve to make the cognitive representations existing in the minds of separate
> subjects publicly accessible in some enduring fashion. Examples are: a text, a diagram, a map legend, a list, a clinical record, or a controlled
> vocabulary.

### Act (HL7 RIM)

> A record of something that is being done, has been done, can be done, or is intended or requested to be done.

### Representation Theory - Laboratory for Applied Ontology (LOA) : Medical Theories

> In principle, a theory of signs admits that anything can be used to describe anything else. 
> In practice, there are severe limitations on the use of some entity as interpretant of another, 
> and these limitations derive from the cultural and local context, from the symbolic system used, 
> and from the cognitive and ontological underlying motivations. This is a theory which only 
> describes the use of signs as a post-hoc issue, after some intentionality has decided what is an 
> interpretant of what. Interpretant is a relation which holds between any two entities, where the 
> first is used to describe or explain the second. There are background conditions for being an 
> interpretant: an agent should be aware of both the interpretant and the reference, and a context 
> should encompass the agent and the entities involved. Interpretant is reflexive, while symmetry 
> and transitivity are debatable. Symmetry seems inappropriate, since usually some entity is USED 
> as interpretant, and the process is not reverted (not an equivalence). Transitivity holds only 
> if metaphor and metonymy are discarded as possible sense sources in the domain of interpretation.</dc:description>

### Wikipedia Definition

See: [Symptom](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom):

> Strict  ly, a symptom is a sensation or change in health function experienced by a patient. Thus, symptoms may be 
> loosely classified as strong, mild or weak. In this, medically correct, sense of the word, it is a subjective 
> report, as opposed to a sign, which is objective evidence of the presence of a disease or disorder. Examples of 
> symptoms are fatigue/tiredness, pain, or nausea. In contrast, elevated blood pressure, or abnormal appearance of 
> the retina, would be a medical sign indicating the nature of the disease.
